# Identification-of-Cultural-Patterns
Codebooks for MACSS 40400: The Computational Identification of Cultural Patterns

In assignment 2, I scrape Twitter for the #LetsGoBrandon hashtag and perform a sentiment analysis and text analysis to identify the contexts the hashtag is used in.
Comprehensive instructions are in the Jupyter Notebook and the attached JSON file contains the tweets I have scraped

In assignment 3, I use the music_df.csv and data_by_year.csv files to explore the homogenization of music in the Billboard 100 and the larger population of songs respectively. I then use the frequency of terms from the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) to predict these trends in homogenization.
